Isabel Jaramillo

My strengths are in writing HTML and I feel like I have developed a more
organized strategy where I can write with neat HTML syntax. I'd like to say I'm 'okay' with
CSS but would like to brush up on my skills working on media queries and layouts.
Javascript is my greatest weakness right now - but I am excited to work with it and
hope to get as much as I can out of this given this last project!

I believe that my strengths are in CSS. I like to make sure that my CSS is organized and I like to add in media queries to clean up the page and make it more responsive.
My weakness is JavaScript, purely based off of the reason that I haven't practiced using it yet. I'm sure that after this project I will gain more experience.

My strengths lie in Javascript, Im able to pick up new topics fairly quickly and easily and I am able to implement them with much success. 
I would like to work on integrating API into a webpage through javascript. I have never done it before and this project will give me that challenge.
